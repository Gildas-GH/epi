# Epi - Convert any YouTube channel into a downloadable playlist

##Head over to Youtube and find the URL of your favorite user, channel, or playlist.

The URL will look like one of these:
https://m.youtube.com/user/latenight
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTyTA7-g9nopHeHbeuvpRA
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb

##Open your podcasts app and add a new podcast by URL. Copy and paste in the URL from step 1, except type in epi right before youtube.

Your modified URL should look like one of these:</p>
https://m.epiyoutube.com/user/latenight
https://www.epiyoutube.com/channel/UCVTyTA7-g9nopHeHbeuvpRA
https://www.epiyoutube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb

Epi generates audio podcasts by default. If you'd like a video podcast instead, add ?vid=1 to the end of the URL for users or channels:

https://m.epiyoutube.com/user/latenight?vid=1
https://www.epiyoutube.com/channel/UCVTyTA7-g9nopHeHbeuvpRA?vid=1
https://www.epiyoutube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&vid=1

##Hit subscribe. You're all set. You can now download and refresh episodes, just like with any other podcast.
