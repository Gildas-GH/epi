## 1. Head over to YouTube in your browser, and find the URL of your favorite user, channel, or playlist.

The URL will look like one of these:

+ `https://m.youtube.com/user/latenight`
+ `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTyTA7-g9nopHeHbeuvpRA`
+ `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb`

## 2. Open up your podcasts app and add a new podcast by URL. Copy and paste in the URL from step 1, except type in `epi` right before `youtube`.

Your modified URL should look like one of these:
+ `https://m.epiyoutube.com/user/latenight`
+ `https://www.epiyoutube.com/channel/UCVTyTA7-g9nopHeHbeuvpRA`
+ `https://www.epiyoutube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb`

Note: Epi generates audio podcasts by default. If you'd like a video podcast instead, add `?vid=1` to the end of the URL for users or channels, or `&vid=1` for playlists:

+ `https://m.epiyoutube.com/user/latenight?vid=1`
+ `https://www.epiyoutube.com/channel/UCVTyTA7-g9nopHeHbeuvpRA?vid=1`
+ `https://www.epiyoutube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&vid=1`

## 3. Hit subscribe. You're all set. You can now download and refresh episodes, just like with any other podcast.
